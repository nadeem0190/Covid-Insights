# Covid-Insights
Data Exploration on Covid-19 from February 2020 to December 2022 using PostgreSQL

The datasets used is provided in https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
After some work on the original dataset, I separated data into two workbooks for a better understanding of both deaths that happened with Covid-19, and details provided on vaccinations.
The two CSV file are later imported in PG-Admin to work on PostgreSQL to explore the data further.
